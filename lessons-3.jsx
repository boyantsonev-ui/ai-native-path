        <div className="cheat-card"><h5>.md — markdown</h5><p>The lingua franca. SKILL.md, READMEs, design briefs, voice guides. If Claude reads it, it's probably markdown.</p></div>
        <div className="cheat-card"><h5>.mdx — markdown + components</h5><p>Markdown that lets you embed React. Documentation sites, marketing pages, product tours.</p></div>
        <div className="cheat-card"><h5>.yaml — config</h5><p>Human-friendly settings. CI pipelines, agent configs, design tokens, Vercel.</p></div>
        <div className="cheat-card"><h5>schema.json</h5><p>The shape of your data. Tell Claude what "valid" means and you'll never debug a typo again.</p></div>
