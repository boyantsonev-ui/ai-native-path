        At the top — <strong>a host</strong> that talks to you (Claude Desktop, Claude Code). In the middle — <strong>a protocol</strong> that lets that host call any tool (MCP).

    <h1 style={{ marginTop: 14, marginBottom: 18 }}>Three surfaces — Chat, Cowork, Code</h1>
    <p className="lede">
      The Claude desktop app has three modes at the top of every window: <strong>Chat</strong>, <strong>Cowork</strong>, and <strong>Code</strong>. Each sits at a different point on the control spectrum — from pure conversation to fully autonomous action. Knowing which to reach for is half the skill.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>The three modes at a glance</h3>
      <div className="two-col" style={{ gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(3, 1fr)" }}>
        <div className="cheat-card">
          <h5>Chat</h5>
          <p>Conversational. You ask, Claude replies. Great for thinking, critique, strategy, copy, and image review. Context resets each session unless you're in a Project.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="cheat-card">
          <h5>Cowork</h5>
          <p>Collaborative. Claude works <em>alongside</em> you with tools — it can read files, call APIs, and take actions, but you're directing at every step. The pair-programming feel.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="cheat-card">
          <h5>Code</h5>
          <p>Agentic. Claude runs a loop — plan, act, observe, repeat — directly on your codebase. You describe the task ("add a dark-mode token layer to the design system"), approve the plan, and Claude reads files, writes changes, and stages a commit. Lesson 3 covers installation and your first session.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <Callout kind="note" title="Same app, three gears">
        You switch modes with one click. The MCP servers, Projects, and Routines you configure are available across all three — the mode only changes how autonomous Claude is, not what it can reach.
      </Callout>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Chat — the thinking partner</h3>
      <p>
        Chat is the conversational mode. Every session has four active layers you can see and control:
      </p>
      <div className="two-col">
        <div className="cheat-card">
          <h5>Context window</h5>
          <p>Everything in the current conversation — your messages, Claude's replies, tool results, attached files. Resets each new session unless you're in a Project.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="cheat-card">
          <h5>System prompt</h5>
          <p>Set by your Project Instructions or a Skill. Invisible to the thread but shapes every reply — your voice, principles, and constraints.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="cheat-card">
          <h5>Attached files & images</h5>
          <p>Drag PDFs, screenshots, Figma exports, or CSVs straight into the chat. The context window <em>is</em> the upload — no separate file UI needed.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="cheat-card">
          <h5>Connected tools (MCP)</h5>
          <p>When a server is connected, Claude sees its tools alongside your message. It calls them silently when relevant — you see the result, not the plumbing.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Projects — a brief that compounds</h3>
      <p>
        A Project is a named container for related sessions, with shared <strong>Project Instructions</strong> — a system prompt every chat in that project inherits. Write it once; Claude reads it at the start of every session. Update it as the brief evolves.
      </p>
      <div className="two-col">
        <div className="cheat-card">
          <h5>What to pin in Project Instructions</h5>
          <p>Design principles, voice guide, brand colors (hex), component-naming conventions, current sprint goal, Figma file link, stakeholder names.</p>
        </div>
        <div className="cheat-card">
          <h5>What Projects are not</h5>
          <p>Not auto-growing memory. Claude doesn't write your instructions for you — you write them. The context resets each session; the instructions do not.</p>

      <h3>Cowork — Claude as a co-worker, not a chatbot</h3>
      <p>
        Cowork is the middle mode: Claude has tools and can take actions, but the interaction stays close and conversational — you're directing step by step, not handing off a full brief. Think of it as the difference between <em>asking someone a question</em> (Chat) and <em>working side-by-side at the same desk</em> (Cowork).
      </p>
      <p>
        In Cowork, Claude can open files, call your connected MCP servers, iterate on content, and show you intermediate results — all within a single flowing session. You see every action as it happens and can redirect at any point.
      </p>
      <div className="two-col">
        <div className="cheat-card">
          <h5>Good for Cowork</h5>

        </div>
        <div className="cheat-card">
          <h5>Not the right mode when…</h5>
          <p>The task is purely conversational (use Chat) · or the task is "go build the whole feature" (use Code — see Claude Code). Cowork is for tasks you want to <em>steer</em> as they happen.</p>

## Tech stack
React 18 via CDN (no build step). JSX transpiled by Babel standalone.
All lessons are .jsx files loaded as <script type="text/babel">.

## File structure
lessons-1.jsx   → Lessons 1–4  (intro + tools)
lessons-2.jsx   → Lessons 5–9  (foundations + wiring)
lessons-3.jsx   → Lessons 10–13 (ship + measure)
feedback.jsx    → Learning loop (feedback panel, admin dashboard)
app.jsx         → Shell (sidebar, navigation, state)
styles.css      → Single stylesheet (design tokens at :root)

## Dev workflow
Open index.html via a local static server (npx serve . -p 4200).
No npm run dev. No build step. Changes are live on page reload.

## Conventions
- Components: PascalCase. CSS classes: kebab-case.
- All lesson components exported via Object.assign(window, {...}).
- New CSS goes at the end of styles.css, not inline.

# Weekly design audit

## Context
Read the Figma file from the Project Instructions.
Read the latest Vercel preview URL from the last deploy log.

## Steps
1. Pull all frames tagged "production-ready" from Figma.
2. Screenshot the equivalent pages on Vercel via figma-console.
3. Compare token values (spacing, color, typography) frame by frame.
4. Flag drift as: trivial / minor / major.
5. Write the report to the output file.

## Output format
- Executive summary (2 sentences)
- Drift table: Frame | Token | Figma | Prod | Severity
- Recommended fixes, ordered by severity`}

        Once the file is in <code>.claude/commands/</code>, it appears in the <strong>Routines</strong> panel in the Claude Code desktop sidebar. You can trigger it manually from there, see its last run, and read its output — no terminal needed. To wire the schedule without editing the frontmatter by hand, ask Claude in Cowork mode: <em>"Schedule my weekly-audit routine for every Monday at 9am."</em>

        The feedback you leave at the bottom of each lesson is exported as JSON and processed by a weekly routine — <code>feedback-synthesis.md</code> — which runs in the Routines sidebar. It produces the HITL proposals visible in the Admin Dashboard (click the brand logo 5× to open it, then go to Automations). You are looking at a routine's output right now.

# Brand critique

You are reviewing work against the **Acme** voice guide.

## Voice principles
- Plain words. Short sentences. No marketing tics ("seamlessly", "unleash").
- Lead with the verb. The reader is busy.
- Trust over hype: name the trade-off, don't hide it.

## Process
1. Restate what the copy is trying to do, in one line.
2. Flag every line that breaks a principle, with a fix.
3. Offer one bolder rewrite at the end.

## Reference
See \`examples/before-after.md\` for the bar.`}

      <h3>How Claude finds it</h3>
      <p>You don't have to "import" a skill. Claude reads the <code>description</code> and <code>when_to_use</code> in the frontmatter and decides — same way it decides which tool to call. Write those two lines like a search query for your future self.</p>

      <h3>Skills in Claude Code vs Claude.ai</h3>
      <p>Skills follow the same open standard everywhere, but how you manage and invoke them differs by surface.</p>
      <div className="two-col">
        <div className="cheat-card">
          <h5>Claude Code</h5>
          <p>Skills are <strong>files on disk</strong>. Store them in <code>.claude/skills/</code> inside your repo (project-scoped) or <code>~/.claude/skills/</code> (personal, all repos). Invoke with <code>/skill-name</code> or let Claude auto-trigger. Edit the SKILL.md directly — changes take effect in the current session without restarting.</p>

          <p>Skills are <strong>uploaded via UI</strong>. Go to Customize › Skills, toggle example skills on, or upload your own as a ZIP. Claude auto-triggers them — no slash command needed. On Enterprise, owners can provision skills org-wide so they appear for every user automatically.</p>
