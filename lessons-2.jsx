    <p className="lede">
      "Agent" is the most overloaded word in tech. Anthropic's research <em>Building effective agents</em> draws a clean line: <strong>workflows</strong> are LLMs orchestrated by code. <strong>Agents</strong> are LLMs that orchestrate themselves. Both are useful — knowing which you need is the skill.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>The atom: an augmented LLM</h3>
      <p>Every pattern below is built from one building block — an LLM with three augmentations: retrieval (it can look things up), memory (it remembers across turns), and tools (it can act).</p>
      <AgentDiagram kind="augmented-llm" />
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Workflows: predictable, traceable</h3>
      <p>You wrote the path. The LLM fills the steps. Use these when the task is well-defined and you need consistency.</p>
      <AgentDiagram kind="prompt-chain" />
      <p style={{ marginTop: 16 }}><strong>Prompt chaining</strong> — break a task into steps. Each step's output feeds the next. Best for: long content (extract → outline → draft → polish), translation pipelines, structured generation.</p>

      <AgentDiagram kind="router" />
      <p style={{ marginTop: 16 }}><strong>Routing</strong> — classify the input, send it down the right branch. Best for: support triage, model-tier selection (cheap → smart), multi-product chat.</p>

      <AgentDiagram kind="parallel" />
      <p style={{ marginTop: 16 }}><strong>Parallelization</strong> — run the same input through several lenses (vote) or split into independent chunks (sectioning). Best for: safety classifiers, multi-perspective review, long-doc summarization.</p>
    </section>

    <Callout kind="note" title="Workflow-first heuristic">
      Reach for workflows whenever the task is repeatable and the cost of a wrong path is high. They're cheaper, faster, and easier to debug than autonomous agents.

    <h1 style={{ marginTop: 14, marginBottom: 18 }}>Sub-agents & the orchestrator pattern</h1>
    <p className="lede">
      Once a single Claude is doing too many jobs at once, split it. The orchestrator pattern keeps a "lead" model planning and delegating, while focused sub-agents do narrow, well-scoped work.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>How it composes</h3>
      <AgentDiagram kind="orchestrator" />
      <p style={{ marginTop: 16 }}>
        The lead agent reads the goal, decomposes it, and spawns sub-agents — each with its own system prompt, tools, and budget. Results flow back up; the lead synthesizes. Think: a creative director with a researcher, a writer, and a reviewer.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>The evaluator–optimizer loop</h3>
      <AgentDiagram kind="evaluator" />
      <p style={{ marginTop: 16 }}>
        A second pattern worth knowing: a generator drafts, an evaluator critiques, the generator revises. This is how you get quality without writing rules — Claude grading Claude, with you setting the rubric.

    <Callout kind="do" title="Builder translation">
      <p style={{ margin: 0 }}>An <strong>orchestrator</strong> is your art director. <strong>Sub-agents</strong> are specialist freelancers. <strong>Evaluator/optimizer</strong> is your design crit. You already run this team — agents just let you scale it.</p>

    <Callout kind="warn" title="Official write is in active beta">
      As of mid-2026, the Official Figma MCP's write capabilities require full seats on paid plans and are still evolving rapidly. Expect API changes. For stable programmatic writes today, Console MCP is the more reliable option. Check the <a href="https://www.figma.com/developers/mcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official changelog</a> before building write-heavy workflows on the official server.
    </Callout>

    <Callout kind="do" title="Builder leverage">
      Once Figma is on MCP, the source of truth becomes <em>the file</em> again — not a Storybook fork or screenshots in a Linear ticket. Drift becomes detectable. Accessibility becomes auditable. Reviews become quantitative.
