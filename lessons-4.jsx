      Designs without signal are opinions. With analytics MCP servers, Claude can pull behavioural data from PostHog, Microsoft Clarity, and Hotjar — and synthesize it into design changes you can ship the same afternoon.

The illustration above the fold is pushing the form out of view on iPhone SE.\n\n③ The 'Skip for now' link is being clicked 4× more than the primary CTA on Step 4. Either remove it or make 'Skip' actually skip (it currently re-prompts).\n\nWant me to mock fixes 1 and 2 in Figma and open PRs for 3?" },
